# LENIE
Node Importance Estimation Leveraging LLMs for Semantic Augmentation in Knowledge Graphs

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code and datasets for the paper, with the downstream NIE models used in the paper available in their respective original repositories. 

## How to use
1. xxx_data_preprocess.py
2. llm_combine.py
3. xxx_bert_embedding.py
4. The semantically augmented embeddings from the previous steps are fed into the downstream NIE models for node embedding initialization.
